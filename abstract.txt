Treponema pallidum (TP) is a gram negative, spirochaete bacterium with motile capabilities which causes sexual transmitted diseases being the prime example syphilis. Despite the advances in treatment and medicine this bacteria is still endemic in many locations even in developed countries. 
The virulence and transmission vector component of the bacteria are decisive factors for its prevalence and even resurgence in many communities. Although syphilis is quite noticeable in later stages it is considered a stealth infection as it presents little to no acute symptoms. This contributes to its resurgence and it is strongly related to risk behavior. 
As there is currently no vaccine and a resistance to penicillin (the most effective widely used antibiotic for TP infections) is more than likely to occur due to the widespread use, bioinformatic analysis is extremely valuable. 
In this web page the locus 381901 – 501800 of the TP genome is studied exhaustively for its genetic, metabolic and taxonomic data and annotations for hypothetical and understudied proteins are made and are ready to be consulted.
